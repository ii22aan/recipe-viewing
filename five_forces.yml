# This file is in YAML format.  You must ensure that the punctuation
# and whitespace is preserved.  Also, beware of ':' and quotation mark
# characters: these have meaning in YAML and so must be "escaped" by
# enclosing the entire field in (single) quotation marks, or using the multi-line string formatting characters ('|' for preserving newlines, '>' for folding newlines).
# See the YAML specification  (https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/) or the wikipedia page about YAML (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
# Also, Educative has a nice YAML tutorial (https://www.educative.io/blog/yaml-tutorial) that gives a nice rationale for learning YAML.

# Write a short description of your application
topic: RecipeRatings is designed to give users an easy and engaging way to discover the most popular recipes at the moment. 

# For the following sections, you may write multiple paragraphs, each
# with multiple lines, under the key. But be sure *every* line is
# indented at the same level as the first line under the key (see
# `example.yml` for examples).

# Note that the '>' character means the text spanning multiple lines
# should be concatenated into a single paragraph.  Paragraphs are
# separated by blank lines, and *all* lines must be indented.

# Write your assessment of the rivalry between existing competitors.
competitor_rivalry: >
  The online recipe space is highly competitive, with well-established 
  platforms like AllRecipes, Food Network, and Yummly dominating the market. 
  Other competitors are food blogs, YouTube cooking channels, and social media 
  recipe influencers who share trending recipes.

# Write your assessment of the threat of new entrants.
new_entrant_threat: >
  Entry barriers are relatively low, as new recipe websites can be launched 
  with minimal investment. But gaining traction requires partnerships and an 
  engaged user base. Existing platforms already have brand loyalty and 
  user-generated content, making it harder for newcomers to gain visibility.

# Write your assessment of the threat of substitute products or services.
substitute_threat: >
  Substitutes include traditional cookbooks, TV cooking shows, 
  social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, 
  and even AI-powered recipe generators.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of customers.  
customer_power: >
  Users have many free alternatives, meaning their loyalty isn’t guaranteed. 
  If they don’t find value in RecipeRatings (e.g., unique recipes, an engaging UI, or a strong community), 
  they can easily switch to competitors. To keep users the site could incorporate gamification, rewards for engagement, 
  or AI-powered personalized suggestions.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of suppliers.
supplier_power: >
  Suppliers in this case would be content creators, bloggers, or even AI-generated recipe databases.
  High-quality recipe content is widely available, but building partnerships with chefs, influencers, 
  or food brands could differentiate the platform.

# Write your conclusion regarding the appropriate competitive strategy to pursue, based on
# your assessments above.

  To stand out in the crowded recipe space, RecipeRatings should focus on personalization and community engagement. 
  Using AI to recommend recipes based on user preferences can make the platform feel more tailored. Encouraging users to rate,
  review, and share their own recipes will build a sense of community. Partnering with food influencers and offering 
  rewards for engagement can also help attract and keep users. By creating a more interactive and personalized experience, 
  RecipeRatings can set itself apart from bigger competitors.
